# Welcome to #DataDecember

We know you love data! And we believe you must have the happiest start in your journey into data science. Say hello to #DataDecember, a 30-day initiative by LSE’s Data Science Society to provide high-quality, beginner-friendly material to pick up data science concepts.

## Ugh! Another beginner-level set of materials!?

Definitely not! **We value your time as much as we value ours**. That means our resources will not involve articles that lack an important learning point. Also, all the material we provide will be what we have already learnt from and summarised. So, you actually are learning from other learners who are are able to identify the exact roadblocks you might hit as beginners. 

As Rachel Thomas, co-founder of fast.ai puts it, [“You are best positioned to help people one step behind you”](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045). The #DataDecember is our way of believing in that notion and giving back to the constantly evolving and ever-energetic data science community!

## Great! Now, what do I need to know in order to take part?

Nothing! The contents that we will release will assume no prior knowledge on your side.

## How do I take part?
To take part, all you need to do is follow 3 simple steps:

1. Follow LSE Data Science Society on our social media channels(links to be given) if you are not already
2. Keep an eye-out on the daily content releases on this official website maintained by the society
3. Update your daily/weekly progress on social media using the hashtag #DataDecember
