# Welcome to #DataDecember

We know you love data! And we believe you must have a comfortable start in your journey into data science. Say hello to #DataDecember, a 30-day initiative by [LSE’s Data Science Society]([LSESU Data Science Society (dsatlse.github.io)](https://dsatlse.github.io/)) to provide high-quality, beginner-friendly material to pick up data science concepts.

**We value your time as much as we value ours**. That means our resources will not involve articles that lack an important learning point. Also, all the material we provide will be what we have already learnt from and summarised. So, you actually are learning from other learners who are able to identify the exact roadblocks you might hit as beginners. 

## The Philosophy of #DataDecember

At the society, we strive to build a community of data science enthusiasts with the help of active, hands-on learning for students at LSE. This December we wish to revisit fundamental theory, infuse it with hands-on resources and explain relevant concepts as how a beginner would like to perceive it. Being a beginner does pose obvious challenges such as being overwhelmed by the sheer expanse of topics to cover, the ever-persistent impostor syndrome, spurious knowledge and confusion induced by online articles. A good way to tackle these challenges could be to start learning together as a community, guided by steps figured out by fellow beginners and experts alike. 

Through #DataDecember, we hope to cultivate a data movement that could help beginners and experts engage with each other and proliferate quality data knowledge.

As Rachel Thomas, co-founder of fast.ai puts it, [“You are best positioned to help people one step behind you”](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045). The #DataDecember is our way of believing in that notion and giving back to the constantly evolving and ever-energetic data science community!

## How to take part in #DataDecember

The #DataDecember campaign will be run throughout the month of December. We shall continue to post our content here everyday and also engage through our social media handles. You could make things more interesting by engaging with the hashtag on social media and thus contribute to the nest big social media hashtag of our times!

To take part, all you need to do is follow 3 simple steps:

1. Follow LSE Data Science Society on our social media channels([check here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEOnf6RnOA/LghQr0ctg-fa3p-A2TO9Ig/view)) if you are not already
2. Keep an eye-out on the daily content releases on this official website maintained by the society
3. Update your daily/weekly progress on social media using the hashtag #DataDecember

## Contributors

#DataDecember has been conceived, operationalized and fueled by the data-related interests of some of us at the society. We would love to have a chat with you if you are interested!

## Day 1: What is Data Science?

*Author: Ramshankar Yadhunath*  

> "Data scientists are kind of like the new Renaissance folks, because data science is inherently multidisciplinary" - John Foreman

In this pilot article for #DataDecember, let’s address the elephant in the room – *What is data science?*

First, let’s understand what is meant by “data”. Data is essentially a set of characteristics about a particular observation. This observation could be anything that is uniquely identifiable, for example a person or an organization. Think of it like this – When you watch a movie on an over-the-top (OTT) platform, you essentially are acting as an observation and the genres you like watching could be one of your characteristics.

Now, let’s take the idea a level higher. What if the platform wanted to provide you with recommendations that you would want to see? This is where data science begins to show itself. Data about your watching patterns could be analyzed and used to predict how likely you would be to love a new movie X. Based on this, your recommendation list could be created. Sounds easy enough?

A formal definition of data science that is universally accepted is non-existent. However, most of the definitions out there are closely related. For the sake of simplicity, let’s just think of data science as an *intersection of statistical skills, computing skills and domain knowledge*. While the first two are easy to understand, domain knowledge is not intuitively understood, especially if you are a beginner. Domain knowledge is the knowledge about the kind of data you are working with, including topics such as its origin and the meaning it contributes to the “problem”. The problem refers to the “what you want to achieve” part of your data science project.

**What the beginner thinks**  

Woah! So many articles defining data science in different ways. This is stressful! How do I know what I am learning?

If this sounds like you, don’t worry. This is how every beginner sounds like. Do not bother too much about the definition, unless clear definitions are indispensable parts of what you do. In the simplest sense, think of data science as an endeavour to convert data to value.
