# Welcome to #DataDecember

We know you love data! And we believe you must have a comfortable start in your journey into data science. Say hello to #DataDecember, a 30-day initiative by [LSE’s Data Science Society]([LSESU Data Science Society (dsatlse.github.io)](https://dsatlse.github.io/)) to provide high-quality, beginner-friendly material to pick up data science concepts.

**We value your time as much as we value ours**. That means our resources will not involve articles that lack an important learning point. Also, all the material we provide will be what we have already learnt from and summarised. So, you actually are learning from other learners who are able to identify the exact roadblocks you might hit as beginners. 

## The Philosophy of #DataDecember

At the society, we strive to build a community of data science enthusiasts with the help of active, hands-on learning for students at LSE. This December we wish to revisit fundamental theory, infuse it with hands-on resources and explain relevant concepts as how a beginner would like to perceive it. Being a beginner does pose obvious challenges such as being overwhelmed by the sheer expanse of topics to cover, the ever-persistent impostor syndrome, spurious knowledge and confusion induced by online articles. A good way to tackle these challenges could be to start learning together as a community, guided by steps figured out by fellow beginners and experts alike. 

Through #DataDecember, we hope to cultivate a data movement that could help beginners and experts engage with each other and proliferate quality data knowledge.

As Rachel Thomas, co-founder of fast.ai puts it, [“You are best positioned to help people one step behind you”](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045). The #DataDecember is our way of believing in that notion and giving back to the constantly evolving and ever-energetic data science community!
