# Welcome to #DataDecember

We know you love data! And we believe you must have a comfortable start in your journey into data science. Say hello to #DataDecember, a 30-day initiative by [LSE’s Data Science Society]([LSESU Data Science Society (dsatlse.github.io)](https://dsatlse.github.io/)) to provide high-quality, beginner-friendly material to pick up data science concepts.

**We value your time as much as we value ours**. That means our resources will not involve articles that lack an important learning point. Also, all the material we provide will be what we have already learnt from and summarised. So, you actually are learning from other learners who are able to identify the exact roadblocks you might hit as beginners. 

## The Philosophy of #DataDecember

At the society, we strive to build a community of data science enthusiasts with the help of active, hands-on learning for students at LSE. This December we wish to revisit fundamental theory, infuse it with hands-on resources and explain relevant concepts as how a beginner would like to perceive it. Being a beginner does pose obvious challenges such as being overwhelmed by the sheer expanse of topics to cover, the ever-persistent impostor syndrome, spurious knowledge and confusion induced by online articles. A good way to tackle these challenges could be to start learning together as a community, guided by steps figured out by fellow beginners and experts alike. 

Through #DataDecember, we hope to cultivate a data movement that could help beginners and experts engage with each other and proliferate quality data knowledge.

As Rachel Thomas, co-founder of fast.ai puts it, [“You are best positioned to help people one step behind you”](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045). The #DataDecember is our way of believing in that notion and giving back to the constantly evolving and ever-energetic data science community!

## Day 1: What is Data Science?

*Author: Ramshankar Yadhunath*  

> "Data scientists are kind of like the new Renaissance folks, because data science is inherently multidisciplinary" - John Foreman

In this pilot article for #DataDecember, let’s address the elephant in the room – *What is data science?*

First, let’s understand what is meant by “data”. Data is essentially a set of characteristics about a particular observation. This observation could be anything that is uniquely identifiable, for example a person or an organization. Think of it like this – When you watch a movie on an over-the-top (OTT) platform, you essentially are acting as an observation and the genres you like watching could be one of your characteristics.

Now, let’s take the idea a level higher. What if the platform wanted to provide you with recommendations that you would want to see? This is where data science begins to show itself. Data about your watching patterns could be analyzed and used to predict how likely you would be to love a new movie X. Based on this, your recommendation list could be created. Sounds easy enough?

A formal definition of data science that is universally accepted is non-existent. However, most of the definitions out there are closely related. For the sake of simplicity, let’s just think of data science as an *intersection of statistical skills, computing skills and domain knowledge*. While the first two are easy to understand, domain knowledge is not intuitively understood, especially if you are a beginner. Domain knowledge is the knowledge about the kind of data you are working with, including topics such as its origin and the meaning it contributes to the “problem”. The problem refers to the “what you want to achieve” part of your data science project.

**What the beginner thinks**  

Woah! So many articles defining data science in different ways. This is stressful! How do I know what I am learning?

If this sounds like you, don’t worry. This is how every beginner sounds like. Do not bother too much about the definition, unless clear definitions are indispensable parts of what you do. In the simplest sense, think of data science as an endeavour to convert data to value.

## Day 2: The Relevance of Data Science Today

*Author: Maja Lie*

> "We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done" - Alan Turing

The idea of being able to see ahead is a powerful one. Psychologically, humans are not designed to think very long term, so the ability to use data analysis techniques to develop models that can give us some notion of what might occur in the future is extremely useful. That is what data science helps to accomplish. Data science is important because it enables us to take data that is not necessarily interesting on its own and pairs us with tools and methods to transform this data into something insightful. However, not all data science models need to be predictive ones; descriptive models can be useful for identifying why a certain product is not selling as well at a company. 

In today’s world, data science is increasingly relevant as the amount of data companies, websites, and other organisations collect on us is exploding. The rise of the internet has led to the easy and rapid collection of people’s personal data: banking information, geographical location, and even what websites and products you click on. This information can drive important business questions. For example, analysing what products are often bought together at a grocery store might influence your local Tesco to change their store layout. If you think about it, data science changes the world around you everywhere. Next time you’re in a store or shopping online, think about how your information might have been used to design a better experience for you as a customer or how advertisements are catered to you. 

Because of how powerful data science can be in driving insights which, in turn, often drive profits, the demand for data scientists is high. Even a small amount of knowledge on the subject is desirable and attractive to employers! As students, we are in the perfect time to learn these skills for our future, which is why data science has become such a big buzzword. 

**What the beginner thinks**

Data science is a big, scary buzzword that gets thrown around a lot. What does it actually mean? Do I really need to learn it or is this a trend that is just going to disappear eventually?

As a beginner, I thought all of these things when I first started. The truth is, data science really is important in shaping the world around you. Once I started learning about it, I even noticed it changed how I thought about everyday things. I recommend reading a few articles about real applications to see just how important it truly is. One example is targeted advertising. The next time you go online, take note of what you click on and how advertisements change afterwards. Last week, I bought a Christmas sweater and now my advertisements consist of other Christmas sweaters and clothing. When I was on a health kick, advertisements for different diets and gym clothing were more prevalent. These are small, but important ways in which data science impacts us.

## Day 3: The Different Components of Data Science

*Author: Ramshankar Yadhunath*

> "The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways" - Robert Green

In today’s article, let’s explore the different components of data science. In the pilot article, “What is data science?”, we came across the idea that data science is an intersection of stats, coding and domain knowledge. This idea in fact has been adopted from Drew Conway’s representation of data science - The famous data science venn diagram.

![](venn.png)
<center>Fig 1. The data science venn diagram<a href="http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram">(Source)</a></center>

According to this representation, data science is a combination of 
* Hacking skills: This helps manipulate all kinds of data, think algorithmically and use computing resources to deal with large amounts of data
* Math and Statistics Knowledge: The tools required to understand the data and extract meaningful insights from it
* Substantive Expertise: The domain-related knowledge that would help make sense of the insights generated in context to the problem being pursued

Having said that, it is now time to address the limitations of this venn diagram representation. A couple of these are:
* The venn diagram does not take into consideration the necessity of soft skills in data science [(Source)](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-the-data-science-venn-diagram-is-misleading-16751f852063)
* The venn diagram is not an accurate representation of data science in business [(Source)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-data-science-venn-diagram-wrong-kees-groeneveld/)

If you are interested in further abstractions concerning a definition of data science, [this article](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/10/battle-data-science-venn-diagrams.html) could be of help. 

**What the beginner thinks**

So much to learn! How am I going to come to terms with all these multiple components I need? 

It’s very common to think this way. But the idea must be to not bother too much about such abstractions. In practice, you essentially only need to know a good deal of statistics, coding ability, domain knowledge and the most important, the drive to deliver value. While the first 2 can be covered through traditional learning, the last 2 will require you to be driven and passionate about the work you are doing.
